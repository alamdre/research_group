## Description
Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)

## Instructions
1. Find an interest object on google maps (i.e. McDonalds, KFC, etc) and find a region where you can find 6 of them. (If you choose McDonalds, then find a region where you can find 6 McDonalds. Example below).

![Objects on map](https://github.com/basisdatalab/research_group/blob/master/assignment/assignment_2/objects_on_map.png "Objects on map")

2. Screenshot the region and open it on geogebra.
3. Make every objects into a point. (Example below).

![Map on geogebra](https://github.com/basisdatalab/research_group/blob/master/assignment/assignment_2/map_on_geogebra.png "Map on geogebra")

4. Create an order-3 Voronoi Diagram from those objects.
5. Save the geogebra file (*.ggb) and the map screenshot to your corresponding Student Number folder inside the assignment_2 folder.
6. Do the pull request.

May the Force be with you~
