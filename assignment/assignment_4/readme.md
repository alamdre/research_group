# Building Graph Mapping
Time limit: -
Memory limit: -

## Description
In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics))

In graph mapping, every rooms, corridors, and stairs are represented in vertices. For every rooms, corridors, and stairs linkage (can be accessed from another room) are represented in edges.

## Instructions
1. Pick one building and draw a blueprint of that building. The drawing can be simpler than the real building (second floor is a plus value).

![Blueprint](https://github.com/basisdatalab/research_group/blob/master/assignment/assignment_4/blueprint.png "Blueprint")

2. Put a sequential number in each objects (rooms, corridors, and stairs).
3. Create a mapping graph for the blueprint.
4. Save the blueprint and the mapping graph to your corresponding Student Number folder inside the assignment_4 folder.
5. Do the pull request.
